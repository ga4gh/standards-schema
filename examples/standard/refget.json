  "long_description": "Reference sequences are fundamental to genomic analysis and interpretation however naming is a serious issue. For example the reference genomic sequence GRCh38/1 is also known as hg38/chr1, CM000663.2 and NC_000001.11. In addition there is no standardised way to access reference sequence from providers such as INSDC (ENA, Genbank, DDBJ), Ensembl or UCSC.",
